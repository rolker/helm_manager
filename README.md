# Helm Manager

The helm_manager is a Project11 package that helps manage the flow of control commands. It responds to changes in piloting mode to determine which helm or command velocity source to direct to the underlying node controlling the hardware. It also sends a heartbeat message indicating the current piloting mode and status information from the helm node.
